OSIAM is a secure identity management solution providing REST based services for
authentication and authorization. We achieve this by implementing two important
open standards:

* [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)
* [SCIM 2.0](http://www.simplecloud.info/)

OSIAM is published under the MIT licence, giving you the greatest freedom
possible to utilize OSIAM in you project or product.
Watch [our blog](http://osiam.github.io/) to stay informed about releases and upcoming changes.

## Use cases

* [Single app with OSIAM](docs/single-app-use-case.md) as free backing store for
  users and groups and local auth service.
* [Distributed app with OSIAM](docs/distributed-app-use-case.md) as central
  identity store and auth service.
* [Publish your app's API with OSIAM](docs/protected-api-use-case.md) as auth
  service for 3rd-parties and allow safe access to your user's data.

## Quick Start

[Download](https://dl.bintray.com/osiam/downloads/osiam/3.0/osiam-3.0.war) the latest version of OSIAM:

```
curl -L https://dl.bintray.com/osiam/downloads/osiam/3.0/osiam-3.0.war -o osiam.war
```

Make the `.war` file executable:

```
chmod +x osiam.war
```

Start OSIAM:

```
./osiam.war
```

After some seconds, OSIAM should be fully running. You can now retrieve your first access token:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1jbGllbnQ6c2VjcmV0" -X POST -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=ADMIN" http://localhost:8080/oauth/token
```

You can now start to setup OSIAM, by changing the administrator's password and add your own OAuth client.
Please see the [Installation and Configuration Manual](docs/detailed-reference-installation.md#customize-setup) for details.
